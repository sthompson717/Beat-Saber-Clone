Player uses blades attached to controllers to slice floating and rotating cubes in time with the music to score points. Score is based on the angle at which the player collides with the cube in the direction of the arrows. Score multiplier and combo streaks increase with consecutive correct hits. Final score, longest streak, and hit/miss ratio are shown on game over menu.
